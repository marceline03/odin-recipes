<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This Pan-Seared Steak has a garlic rosemary-infused butter that makes it taste steakhouse quality. You’ll be impressed at how easy it is to make the perfect steak – seared and caramelized on the outside, and so juicy inside.

</p>
 
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>

  <ul>
  
    <li>2 New York Strip Steaks</li>
    <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
    <li>Rosemary</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Oil</li>
  </ul>
</p>


<h2>Procedure</h2>

<p>
  <ol>
<li>Pat dry – use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.</li>
<li>Season generously – just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.</li>
<li>Sear steaks – add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</li>
<li>Add butter and aromatics – melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness (see chart below).</li>
<li>Remove steak and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
  </ol>
